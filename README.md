## ❖・Introduction・❖
The midterm assignment for this course is a conceptual and technical *pitch* for your final NIME projects. You will use graphics and plain English to take the class and the professors through your NIME idea. Once approved, your midterms will serve as a roadmap toward completing your final NIME projects.

## ❖・Overview・❖
The midterm assignment will consist of three parts:

1. Broad concept, including a rough sketch of your NIME
2. A *detailed technical description* of your proposed NIMEs, including the exact software and hardware you’ll be using for sound creation, and the *mapping* that will influence your sound
3. In-class feedback and revisions of the concept. More on each of these points below...

### 1. Concept
The first requirement for the midterm is to convey the overall concept of your NIME through visuals and a basic description. Think of this as a *pitch.* You are on Shark Tank and you are trying to “sell” the class on your idea for a NIME as if we were all investors. The description must convey the basics of *what* your NIME is, *how* it makes sound, and *why* it is unique and worthy of exploration. The N in NIME stands for *New* after all, so this idea should be novel and exciting.

You should also include a drawing or graphical representation of what your NIME will look like when it is finished. This visual should create some sense of *scale* so that we can evaluate how best to video your performance. Also keep in mind that the ME in NIME stands for *musically expressive,* so you should be able to give us a clear sense that this is an interface capable of not just creating *sound* but also of creating *expressive music.*

### 2. Technical Description
The technical description will make up the majority of content. This description needs to include *as many details as possible* to give us an exact idea of the following:

1. What software/hardware components you will need
2. How these components will “talk” to each other and synchronize
3. The logical structures that your NIME will make use of (ie, programming logic behind the sound)
4. What actions/data will be *triggering* the sound
5. General aesthetic characteristics of the sound
6. A detailed graphical representation of your strategies for mapping parameters (ie, when the temperature in the room goes up, the volume goes up, etc)
7. A general plan of action (ie, how will you approach the creation of this NIME, and will it fit into our class schedule?)
8. Anything else that you can possibly think of that will affect the planning, execution, and performance/recording of your NIME. You should consider including *videos or audio* as sound and visual references if your NIME contains qualities comparable to other instruments

### 3. Presentation
Finally, you will present your midterm NIME proposals in class on 6 October. These proposals should be in the form of a slide deck as a PDF, PowerPoint, or Keynote file that you can share with the class. (**Only PDF, PowerPoint, or Keynote files will be accepted.**) **The deck, regardless of format, must be 5MB or smaller.** Audio and video is encouraged as well as graphics and visual models. Each presentation should last no more than 10 minutes, and there will be about 10 minutes of feedback given to each presentation.

You will receive feedback on:

1. How realistic your plan of action is based on the complexity of your NIME
2. How well your presentation reflects the *spirit* of NIME (ie, is this interface *new?* Is it *musically expressive?*)
3. How effectively you were able to communicate the *conceptual and technical details* of your proposed NIME

## ❖・Grading・❖
Your grade is based on the quality of your deck, how your present it, and the inventiveness of your NIME. How well you follow these instructions is also calculated into your grade.

| Item                           | Points |
|--------------------------------|:------:|
| *Deck*                         | `25`   |
| *Presentation*                 | `25`   |
| *Inventiveness*                | `25`   |
| *Following these instructions* | `25`   |

## ❖・Due・❖
Wednesday, 6 October 2020, at 1:00 PM.

## ❖・Submission・❖

1. Name your deck `midterm-presentation.pdf` if you’re using Adobe Acrobat, `midterm-presentation.ppt` if you’re using Microsoft PowerPoint, or `midterm-presentation.key` if you’re using Apple Keynote. **You may _not_ compose your deck using a software package that is not one of the aforementioned.** **Do not** submit multiple files; only one of type `.pdf`, `.ppt`, or `.key` will be accepted.
2. Add your deck into your named branch in this repo, then commit and push it.
3. Issue a pull request back into the original repo, the one from which your fork was created for this project. See the **Issuing Pull Requests** section of [this site](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/index.html) for help on how to submit your assignment.

**Note**: This assignment may *only* be submitted via GitHub. **No other form of submission will be accepted**.
